# 6to5-node-server

A sensible starting point for building modern Node.js servers

# Goals

* Write Node.js server apps using modern Javascript via [6to5](https://6to5.org/)
* Remain lightweight and easily adaptable (don't lock users into a framework!)
* Embrace [Twelve-Factor App](http://12factor.net/) principles wherever possible
* When opinions must be enforced, optimize for developer and administrator happiness
